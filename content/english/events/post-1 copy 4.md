# TAPAI @ ISWC 2025: Trust, Autonomy, and Accountability in PKG-Based Agentic AI

**A Dagstuhl-style workshop at ISWC 2025**

Join us at **TAPAI @ ISWC 2025** to explore how **Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs)** can shape the future of **Agentic AI** by fostering trust, autonomy, and accountability. This interactive workshop addresses critical challenges in using personal data for AI-driven automation and personalization.

> The personal AI agent market is projected to reach $56.3 billion by 2034. — [Market Research, 2024](https://example.com)

## About the Workshop

This workshop dives into the role of PKGs in ensuring **trust**, **autonomy**, and **accountability** in Agentic AI. As AI agents leverage personal data, key questions arise: Can they be trusted with sensitive information? How can users maintain control? How do we ensure accountability for misuse? Through discussions and position papers, we’ll explore solutions for user-centric AI.

### Key Topics

- **Trust**: Building confidence in AI systems.
- **Autonomy**: Empowering user control over data.
- **Accountability**: Ensuring responsible AI decisions.
- **Ethics**: Addressing ethical implications.
- **Diversity**: Promoting inclusive perspectives.
- **PKGs**: Personal Knowledge Graphs for AI.
- **Agentic AI**: The next generation of AI agents.

## Motivation & Objectives

> "2025 will be the year of AI Agents." — NVIDIA CEO, November 2024

The rise of AI agents like OpenAI’s Operator and Google’s Jarvis highlights the growing role of Knowledge Graphs in personalization. However, concerns about data abuse are mounting. Sir Tim Berners-Lee called the Web “anti-human” in 2018 due to data centralization, and the EU AI Act emphasizes human rights. Inspired by a Dagstuhl seminar, this workshop aims to:

1. Define requirements for trustworthy PKG-based AI.
2. Ensure user autonomy in AI interactions.
3. Develop accountability mechanisms for AI decisions.
4. Promote ethical diversity in AI systems.

Expected outcomes include a joint manifesto, design recommendations, and new research collaborations, with materials shared openly on our website.

## Call for Position Papers

We invite **1-page position statements** on trust, autonomy, accountability, or ethical diversity in PKG-based AI. Submit by **October 15, 2025**, to [tapai2025@example.com](mailto:tapai2025@example.com). Walk-in presentations are welcome, time permitting.

> Share your vision for ethical AI with PKGs!
