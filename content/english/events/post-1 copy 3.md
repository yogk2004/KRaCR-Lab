**A seminar at ISWC 2025**

Join us at **TAPAI @ ISWC 2025**, a seminar exploring how **Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs)** can foster trust, autonomy, and accountability in Agentic Artificial Intelligence. This session addresses critical challenges in leveraging personal data for AI-driven automation and personalization.

> The personal AI agent market is projected to reach $56.3 billion by 2034. — [Market Research, 2024](https://example.com)

## About the Seminar

This seminar examines how PKGs can ensure **trust**, **autonomy**, and **accountability** in Agentic AI. As AI agents increasingly use personal data, key questions arise: Can they be trusted with sensitive information? How can users maintain control? How do we ensure accountability for misuse? Through expert talks and discussions, we’ll explore solutions for user-centric AI.

### Key Topics

- **Trust**: Building confidence in AI systems.
- **Autonomy**: Empowering user control over data.
- **Accountability**: Ensuring responsible AI decisions.
- **Ethics**: Addressing ethical implications.
- **Diversity**: Promoting inclusive perspectives.
- **PKGs**: Personal Knowledge Graphs for AI.
- **Agentic AI**: The next generation of AI agents.

## Motivation & Objectives

> "2025 will be the year of AI Agents." — NVIDIA CEO, November 2024

The rise of AI agents like OpenAI’s Operator and Google’s Jarvis underscores the role of Knowledge Graphs in personalization. However, concerns about data abuse are growing. Sir Tim Berners-Lee called the Web “anti-human” in 2018 due to data centralization, and the EU AI Act emphasizes human rights. This seminar aims to:

1. Define requirements for trustworthy PKG-based AI.
2. Ensure user autonomy in AI interactions.
3. Develop accountability mechanisms for AI decisions.
4. Promote ethical diversity in AI systems.

## Call for Contributions

We invite **1-page position statements** on trust, autonomy, accountability, or ethical diversity in PKG-based AI. Submit by **October 15, 2025**, to [tapai2025@example.com](mailto:tapai2025@example.com). Selected contributors may present briefly, time permitting.

> Share your vision for ethical AI with PKGs!
